<h1>AutoVis</h1>
<p>AutoVis is a program that visualizes music. It works by utilizing a fast fourier transform to split audio files into bands of frequencies so that they can be displayed on the screen. Additionally, beat onset detection is used to change the color of the background image so that it can respond to the beat of the song. </p>

<p>This was written in Processing, a visual arts programming language based in Java. In order for this to run, the audio library Minim must be installed and moved to the libraries folder of Processing. </p>
